I'll break down the key components of your project that you should highlight in your presentation:

1. **Fuzzy Logic System** (Medical Recommendation Engine):
```python
# In app.py, around line 50-150
def setup_fuzzy_system():
    # This is the core of your fuzzy logic system
    confidence = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(0, 101, 1), 'confidence')
    risk_level = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(0, 11, 1), 'risk_level')
    medical_attention = ctrl.Consequent(np.arange(0, 101, 1), 'medical_attention')
    
    # Membership functions and rules
    # This is where the intelligent decision-making happens
    rule1 = ctrl.Rule(confidence['high'] & risk_level['high'], medical_attention['urgent'])
    rule2 = ctrl.Rule(confidence['high'] & risk_level['medium'], medical_attention['recommended'])
    # ... more rules ...

def get_fuzzy_recommendation(confidence_value, risk_type):
    # This function uses the fuzzy system to make medical recommendations
    # It's a key part of your presentation as it shows how the system
    # converts model predictions into actionable medical advice
```

2. **Grad-CAM (Explainable AI)**:
```python
# In explainable_ai.py
class GradCAM:
    """
    This is your explainable AI component
    It shows WHY the model made its decisions
    """
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.target_layer = self.model.base_model.layer4[-1].conv3
        
    def explain(self, image_path, target_class=None):
        # This method generates the visual explanations
        # It creates heatmaps showing which parts of the image
        # the model focused on for its decision
```

3. **AI/Deep Learning Model**:
```python
# In app.py, around line 30-50
class SkinLesionModel(nn.Module):
    """
    This is your core AI model
    It's a ResNet50-based deep learning model
    """
    def __init__(self, num_classes=7):
        super(SkinLesionModel, self).__init__()
        self.base_model = models.resnet50(weights=None)
        # Custom layers for skin cancer classification
        self.base_model.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_features, 1024),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.5),
            nn.Linear(1024, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.3),
            nn.Linear(512, num_classes)
        )
```

For your presentation, I recommend highlighting these key points:

1. **Fuzzy Logic System**:
   - Show how it combines model confidence with risk levels
   - Demonstrate the three levels of medical recommendations:
     - Self-monitoring
     - Medical Consultation
     - Urgent Medical Attention
   - Explain how it makes the system more practical for medical use

2. **Grad-CAM (Explainable AI)**:
   - Show the heatmap visualizations
   - Explain how it helps doctors understand the model's decisions
   - Demonstrate the overlay images showing which parts of the lesion the model focused on
   - Highlight how this increases trust in the AI system

3. **AI Model**:
   - Show the ResNet50 architecture
   - Explain the custom layers you added
   - Highlight the 7 different types of skin lesions it can classify
   - Show the confidence scores and how they're used

4. **Integration**:
   - Show how these three components work together:
     - AI model makes the initial classification
     - Grad-CAM provides visual explanation
     - Fuzzy logic system converts this into medical recommendations

5. **Practical Application**:
   - Show the web interface
   - Demonstrate the complete workflow:
     1. Image upload
     2. AI classification
     3. Visual explanation
     4. Medical recommendation
   - Highlight how it helps doctors make better decisions

Would you like me to explain any of these components in more detail for your presentation?
