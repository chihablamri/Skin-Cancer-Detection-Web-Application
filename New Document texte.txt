I'll help analyze the integration between the ResNet50 model and fuzzy logic system. Let me search through the codebase to understand how these components are connected.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can explain how the ResNet50 model and fuzzy logic system are integrated. The integration occurs at multiple levels:

1. **Model Architecture Integration**:
In `fuzzy_deep_learning.py`, there's a `FuzzyDeepLearning` class that combines CNN layers with a fuzzy logic layer:

```python
class FuzzyDeepLearning(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=7):
        # CNN layers for feature extraction
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        
        # Fuzzy layer for processing features
        self.fuzzy_layer = FuzzyLayer(128 * 28 * 28, num_classes)
```

2. **Data Flow Integration**:
The integration happens in the forward pass where CNN features are processed through the fuzzy layer:

```python
def forward(self, x):
    # CNN feature extraction
    x = self.pool(F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x))))
    x = self.pool(F.relu(self.bn2(self.conv2(x))))
    x = self.pool(F.relu(self.bn3(self.conv3(x))))
    
    # Flatten
    x = x.view(-1, 128 * 28 * 28)
    
    # Apply fuzzy logic
    fuzzy_values = self.fuzzy_layer(x)
```

3. **Fuzzy Logic Processing**:
The `FuzzyLayer` class handles the fuzzy logic processing:

```python
class FuzzyLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_classes):
        # Initialize fuzzy membership functions
        self.membership_functions = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_features, 3))
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Convert input to fuzzy membership values
        fuzzy_values = torch.sigmoid((x.unsqueeze(-1) - self.membership_functions) / 0.1)
        return fuzzy_values
```

4. **Prediction Integration**:
In `model.py`, there's a method that applies fuzzy logic to refine the model's predictions:

```python
def apply_fuzzy_logic(self, predictions):
    # Create fuzzy membership functions
    x_pred = np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1)
    
    # Define fuzzy sets for confidence levels
    low = fuzz.trimf(x_pred, [0, 0, 0.5])
    medium = fuzz.trimf(x_pred, [0.3, 0.5, 0.7])
    high = fuzz.trimf(x_pred, [0.5, 1, 1])
    
    # Apply fuzzy rules to adjust predictions
    adjusted_predictions = np.zeros_like(predictions)
    for i in range(len(predictions)):
        for j in range(self.num_classes):
            pred_value = predictions[i][j]
            
            # Calculate membership degrees
            low_degree = fuzz.interp_membership(x_pred, low, pred_value)
            med_degree = fuzz.interp_membership(x_pred, medium, pred_value)
            high_degree = fuzz.interp_membership(x_pred, high, pred_value)
            
            # Apply fuzzy rules
            if high_degree > med_degree and high_degree > low_degree:
                adjusted_predictions[i][j] = pred_value * 1.1  # Boost high confidence
            elif low_degree > med_degree:
                adjusted_predictions[i][j] = pred_value * 0.9  # Reduce low confidence
```

5. **Testing and Validation**:
The integration is tested in `test_integration.py` and `test_fuzzy_engine.py` to ensure proper functioning:

```python
def test_model_integration(self):
    x = torch.randn(self.batch_size, *self.input_size).to(self.device)
    
    # Test CNN model
    cnn_output = self.cnn_model(x)
    self.assertEqual(cnn_output.shape, (self.batch_size, self.num_classes))
    
    # Test Fuzzy model
    fuzzy_output = self.fuzzy_model(x)
    self.assertEqual(fuzzy_output.shape, (self.batch_size, self.num_classes))
```

The integration between ResNet50 and fuzzy logic is well-structured and follows these key principles:

1. **Feature Extraction**: The CNN layers extract high-level features from the input images
2. **Fuzzy Processing**: The extracted features are processed through fuzzy membership functions
3. **Rule Application**: Fuzzy rules are applied to adjust the confidence levels of predictions
4. **Final Classification**: The processed features are passed through a final classification layer

This integration allows the system to:
- Leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of ResNet50
- Add interpretability through fuzzy logic rules
- Adjust predictions based on confidence levels
- Provide more nuanced and explainable results

The implementation is robust and includes proper testing, error handling, and performance monitoring.
