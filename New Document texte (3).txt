       print(f"Grad-CAM generation failed: {str(e)}")
       explanation = {
           'heatmap_path': None,
           'overlay_path': None,

   confidence['medium'] = fuzz.trimf(confidence.universe, [30, 60, 90])
   confidence['high'] = fuzz.trimf(confidence.universe, [70, 100, 100])
   ```

2. **Rule Design**

   except:
       # Fallback logic based on risk type
       if risk_type == 'High':
           return {
               'attention_type': 'Medical Attention',
